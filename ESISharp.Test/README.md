# ESISharp.Test

ESISharp **NUnit** Unit Test Project

---

* Create a developer application at [developers.eveonline.com](https://developers.eveonline.com/)
* Copy `dev_secret.json.template` to `dev_secret.json`
* Edit `dev_secret.json` and populate `ClientID` and `SecretKey` with the corresponding values in your application

That should be all that is needed to run the tests.
